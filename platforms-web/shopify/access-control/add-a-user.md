# Add a user

To add a user in Shopify, follow these steps:

1. Log in to your Shopify account and go to the "Settings" section.
2. Click on "Plan and permissions" in the left-hand menu.
3. Scroll down to the "Staff accounts" section and click on the "Add staff account" button.
4. Enter the new user's email address and name.
5. Select a permission level for the new user. The available options are "Full access," "Limited access," and "Custom."
6. If you choose "Limited access" or "Custom," select the specific areas of your store that the user will be able to access and modify.
7. Click "Send invite" to send an email invitation to the new user.
8. The new user will receive an email with a link to create a password and log in to their account.

That's it! The new user will now be able to access your Shopify store with the permission level that you specified. Note that depending on your Shopify plan, you may have a limited number of staff accounts that you can add.

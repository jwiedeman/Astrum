# Upgrade a users access to admin

To upgrade a user's access to admin in Squarespace, follow these steps:

1. Log in to your Squarespace account and go to the "Settings" section.
2. Click on "Permissions" in the left-hand menu.
3. Locate the user you wish to upgrade to admin in the list of users.
4. Click on the "Permissions" button to the right of the user's name.
5. In the "User Role" field, select "Admin" from the drop-down menu.
6. Customize the user's permissions, if desired. You can choose to grant or restrict access to various areas of your Squarespace site, such as pages, commerce, and analytics.
7. Click "Save" to update the user's role and permissions.

That's it! The user will now have full access and permissions to your Squarespace site as an admin. They will be able to view and modify any areas of the site, as well as create and manage other users with lower levels of access and permissions. Note that depending on your Squarespace plan, you may have a limited number of admin users that you can add.

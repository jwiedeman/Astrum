# Access Control

Squarespace provides access control features to allow website owners to grant varying levels of access to their website to different users, depending on their role and responsibilities. Here are the three levels of access control provided by Squarespace:

1. Administrator: An administrator has full access to the Squarespace account and can manage all aspects of the website, including site settings, design, content, and commerce. An administrator can also add, remove or edit users, and set their permission levels.
2. Contributor: A contributor has limited access to the Squarespace account and can only create, edit or publish content. They cannot access the site settings, billing information or other administrative functions.
3. Commenter: A commenter can leave comments on blog posts and pages but cannot make any changes to the site.

The permission levels provided by Squarespace allow website owners to control who can access and make changes to their website, which is particularly useful when there are multiple people involved in managing the site. By granting specific permission levels to each user, website owners can ensure that each user has the access they need to perform their specific role, without giving them access to sensitive or confidential information.

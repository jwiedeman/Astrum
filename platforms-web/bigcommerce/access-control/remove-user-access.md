# Remove user access

To remove a user from BigCommerce, follow these steps:

1. Log in to your BigCommerce account and go to the "Account Settings" section.
2. Click on "Users" in the left-hand menu.
3. Locate the user you wish to remove in the list of users.
4. Click on the "Actions" button to the right of the user's name.
5. Select "Delete user" from the drop-down menu.
6. A confirmation message will appear. Click "Delete user" to confirm the deletion.
7. The user will be removed from your BigCommerce account and will no longer have access to any of the stores or areas of the account that they were previously able to access.

Note: If the user was the only Admin user on your account, you will need to add a new Admin user before you can delete the original one. This is to ensure that there is always at least one user with full access and permissions to your BigCommerce account.

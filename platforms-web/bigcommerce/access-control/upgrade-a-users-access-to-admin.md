2. Click on "Users" in the left-hand menu.
3. Locate the user you wish to upgrade to admin in the list of users.
4. Click on the "Actions" button to the right of the user's name.
5. Select "Edit user" from the drop-down menu.
6. In the "User Role" field, select "Admin" from the drop-down menu.
7. Customize the user's permissions, if desired. You can choose to grant or restrict access to various areas of your BigCommerce account, such as orders, customers, products, and marketing.
8. Click "Save changes" to update the user's role and permissions.

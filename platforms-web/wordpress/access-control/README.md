# Access Control

The Wordpress access control system provides different levels of permissions to users, depending on their role and responsibilities on the site. The different levels of permissions grant users varying degrees of access to the site's features and content.

There are six default roles in WordPress access control, each with different permissions:

1. Super Admin: This role is only available in WordPress Multisite installations, and it has the highest level of access. Super Admins can manage all aspects of the network, including creating and deleting sites, managing user accounts, and installing and updating themes and plugins.
2. Administrator: This role has the highest level of access in a single WordPress site. Administrators can manage all aspects of the site, including creating and editing content, managing users, installing and updating themes and plugins, and changing site settings.
3. Editor: This role can manage and publish content on the site, but they cannot make any major changes to the site's settings or design. They can also moderate comments and manage other users' content.
4. Author: This role can create and publish their own content, but they cannot publish or edit other users' content. They can also manage their own profile and view site statistics.
5. Contributor: This role can create and edit their own content, but they cannot publish it on the site. Instead, their content must be reviewed and published by an Editor or Administrator.
6. Subscriber: This role has the lowest level of access and can only view and comment on content. They cannot create or edit any content on the site.

In addition to these default roles, WordPress allows site owners to create custom roles with specific permissions. This can be useful for granting users access to specific features or content without giving them full administrative access.

Overall, WordPress access control provides a flexible and powerful system for managing user access to a website. The different levels of permissions allow site owners to control who has access to specific features and content, and custom roles can be created to suit specific needs.

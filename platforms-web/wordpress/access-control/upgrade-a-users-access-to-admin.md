# Upgrade a users access to admin

1. Log in to your WordPress website as an administrator.
2. Go to the "Users" section on the left-hand side of the dashboard and find the user you want to upgrade.
3. Click on the user's name to edit their profile.
4. In the "Role" section, select "Administrator" from the dropdown menu.
5. Scroll down and click the "Update Profile" button to save the changes.

That's it! The user's permissions have now been upgraded to admin. They will be able to access all of the administrative features and settings in your WordPress site. Make sure to only upgrade the permissions of users who need access to these features.

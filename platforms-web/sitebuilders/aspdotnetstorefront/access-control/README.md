# Access Control

AspDotNetStorefront provides a flexible and powerful access control system that allows administrators to manage and control user access to various functions and features of the platform. With this system, administrators can assign roles and permissions to users, ensuring that they have access only to the areas of the platform that they need to perform their job duties.

The access control system in AspDotNetStorefront works through user roles. There are several pre-defined roles available in the system, including administrator, order manager, content editor, and customer service representative. Administrators can also create custom roles to fit their organization's specific needs.

Each user role comes with a set of permissions that determine what a user can and cannot do within the platform. For example, an order manager might have permission to manage orders, customers, and returns, while a content editor might have permission to manage products, categories, and pricing.

Administrators can assign user roles to individual users or groups of users, and can also specify which stores each user has access to. This allows organizations to set up access controls that are tailored to their specific needs.

In addition to role-based access control, AspDotNetStorefront also provides other security features, such as user activity logs, two-factor authentication, and IP address restrictions. These features help ensure that only authorized users are able to access the platform and perform sensitive actions.

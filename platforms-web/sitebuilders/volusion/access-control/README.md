# Access Control

Volusion provides a comprehensive access control system that enables administrators to manage and control user access to various functions and features of the platform. With this system, administrators can assign roles and permissions to users, ensuring that they have access only to the areas of the platform that they need to perform their job duties.

The access control system in Volusion works through user roles. There are several predefined roles available in the system, including administrator, manager, customer service representative, and warehouse manager. Administrators can also create custom roles to fit their organization's specific needs.

Each user role comes with a set of permissions that determine what a user can and cannot do within the platform. For example, a customer service representative might have permission to manage customer accounts and orders, while a warehouse manager might have permission to manage inventory and shipments.

Administrators can assign user roles to individual users or groups of users, and can also specify which stores each user has access to. This allows organizations to set up access controls that are tailored to their specific needs.

In addition to role-based access control, Volusion also provides other security features, such as user activity logs, two-factor authentication, and IP address restrictions. These features help ensure that only authorized users are able to access the platform and perform sensitive actions.

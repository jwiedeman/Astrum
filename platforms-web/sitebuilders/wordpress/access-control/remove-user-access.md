# Remove user access

1. Log in to your WordPress website as an administrator.
2. Go to the "Users" section on the left-hand side of the dashboard.
3. Hover over the user you want to remove and click the "Delete" link.
4. In the pop-up window, choose whether you want to delete the user's content or assign it to another user. If you choose to delete the user's content, it will be permanently removed from the website.
5. Click the "Confirm Deletion" button to remove the user from the site.

That's it! The user has now been removed from your WordPress site. Note that deleting a user also removes their access to the site, so make sure to only remove users who no longer need access.

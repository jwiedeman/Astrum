# Access Control

MODX provides a flexible and powerful access control system that enables administrators to manage and control user access to various functions and features of the platform. With this system, administrators can assign roles and permissions to users, ensuring that they have access only to the areas of the platform that they need to perform their job duties.

The access control system in MODX works through user groups and access policies. There are several predefined user groups available in the system, including administrators, webmasters, content editors, and registered users. Administrators can also create custom user groups to fit their organization's specific needs.

Each user group comes with a set of access policies that determine what a user can and cannot do within the platform. For example, a content editor might have permission to manage pages and content, while a registered user might have permission to manage their account details.

Administrators can assign user groups to individual users or groups of users, and can also specify which sections of the website each user has access to. This allows organizations to set up access controls that are tailored to their specific needs.

In addition to role-based access control, MODX also provides other security features, such as user activity logs, two-factor authentication, and IP address restrictions. These features help ensure that only authorized users are able to access the platform and perform sensitive actions.

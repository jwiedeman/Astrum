# Access Control

GoDaddy Sitebuilder 7+ provides a simple role-based access control system that enables website owners to grant access to other users. The platform offers three predefined roles: administrator, editor, and contributor. Administrators have full control over the website and can create and manage all types of content, while editors have the ability to create and edit content, and contributors can only create and submit new content.

To add a user, the website owner must log in to the account and navigate to the "Access" page. From there, they can enter the email address of the user they wish to add and select the role they want to assign to them. Once the user has been added, they will receive an email with instructions on how to access the website.

However, Sitebuilder 7+ does not provide additional customization options for roles or permissions. This means that the access control features are relatively basic and may not be suitable for more complex organizations or websites that require more granular control over user access.

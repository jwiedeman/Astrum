# Access Control

Webs.com is a website builder that allows users to create and host websites without any technical knowledge or experience. While the platform offers some basic access control features, its capabilities in this area are relatively limited.

Webs.com provides a simple role-based access control system that allows users to assign roles and permissions to other users. There are three predefined roles available in the system: owner, administrator, and member. Owners have full control over the website, while administrators have access to most of the website's features, and members have limited access.

Owners and administrators can add or remove members and assign them specific roles, but there are no additional customization options available for roles or permissions. This means that the access control features are relatively basic and may not be suitable for more complex organizations or websites that require more granular control over user access.

Webs.com also provides basic security features, such as password protection for individual pages and SSL encryption for secure data transfer, but again, its capabilities in this area are limited compared to more sophisticated platforms.

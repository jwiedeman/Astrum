# Add a user

To add a user to Americommerce, you will need to have administrator access to the platform. Here are the steps to add a user:

1. Log in to your Americommerce account with your administrator credentials.
2. Click on the "Settings" tab on the top navigation menu, and then select "Users" from the dropdown menu.
3. Click the "Add New User" button on the top right corner of the screen.
4. Fill out the required information for the new user, including their first and last name, email address, and password.
5. Assign a user role to the new user by selecting the appropriate role from the dropdown menu. User roles control what actions a user can perform within the platform.
6. If necessary, assign the user to a specific store or stores by selecting the stores from the "Stores" dropdown menu.
7. Click the "Save" button to create the new user account.

The new user will receive an email with their login credentials and a link to log in to the Americommerce platform. They will be able to access the platform based on the user role and store assignments that you have set up for them.

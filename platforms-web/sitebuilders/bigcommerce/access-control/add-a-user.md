# Add a user

To add a user to BigCommerce, follow these steps:

1. Log in to your BigCommerce account and go to the "Account Settings" section.
2. Click on "Users" in the left-hand menu.
3. Click on the "Add a user" button in the top right corner.
4. Fill out the user's information, including their name, email address, and role.
5. Choose the user's role from the drop-down menu. BigCommerce offers four user roles: Admin, Full-Access Staff, Basic-Access Staff, and Limited-Access Staff. Each role has different levels of access and permissions.
6. Assign the user to one or more stores, if applicable. If you have multiple stores in your BigCommerce account, you can choose which store(s) the user will have access to.
7. Customize the user's permissions, if desired. You can choose to grant or restrict access to various areas of your BigCommerce account, such as orders, customers, products, and marketing.
8. Click "Send invite" to send an email invitation to the user. They will receive an email with a link to set up their account and create a password.

That's it! The user will now be able to log in to your BigCommerce account with their own credentials and access the areas of the account that you've granted them permission to view or modify.

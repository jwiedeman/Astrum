# Remove user access

To remove a user in Shopify, follow these steps:

1. Log in to your Shopify account and go to the "Settings" section.
2. Click on "Plan and permissions" in the left-hand menu.
3. Locate the user you wish to remove in the list of users.
4. Click on the "Delete" button to the right of the user's name.
5. Confirm that you wish to delete the user by clicking on "Delete."

That's it! The user will now be removed from your Shopify store and will no longer have access to any areas or functions. Note that you will not be able to recover any data or information that the user had access to, so make sure to back up any important data before removing a user.

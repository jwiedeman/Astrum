# Upgrade a users access to admin

To upgrade a user's access to admin in Shopify, follow these steps:

1. Log in to your Shopify account and go to the "Settings" section.
2. Click on "Plan and permissions" in the left-hand menu.
3. Locate the user you wish to upgrade to admin in the list of users.
4. Click on the "Edit" button to the right of the user's name.
5. In the "Permission" section, select "Staff account" from the drop-down menu.
6. In the "Staff account" section, select "Full access" in the "Staff permissions" section.
7. Customize the user's permissions, if desired. You can choose to grant or restrict access to various areas of your Shopify store, such as orders, customers, products, and reports.
8. Click "Save" to update the user's role and permissions.

That's it! The user will now have full access and permissions to your Shopify store as an admin. They will be able to view and modify any areas of the store, as well as create and manage other users with lower levels of access and permissions. Note that depending on your Shopify plan, you may have a limited number of staff accounts that you can add.

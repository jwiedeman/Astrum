# Access Control

BigCommerce provides access control features that allow store owners to manage and control access to their store by assigning different levels of permissions to users. Here are the four levels of access control provided by BigCommerce:

1. Store Owner: The store owner has complete control over the store, including access to all store settings, payment information, and other administrative functions. The store owner can also assign user roles and permissions to other users.
2. Store Admin: The store admin has access to all the same store settings as the store owner, but they cannot change the store's payment information or assign user roles and permissions.
3. Staff Manager: The staff manager can add, modify, and delete staff accounts and assign roles and permissions to other staff members. However, they cannot access the store settings or payment information.
4. Staff: The staff role is for employees who need to perform specific tasks, such as managing inventory or fulfilling orders. They have limited access to the store's backend and can only access the features and data necessary to perform their duties.

These permission levels allow store owners to control access to their store and data and ensure that users only have access to the information and functionality necessary to perform their duties. By assigning different roles and permissions, store owners can provide varying levels of access to their store, from full access to limited access, depending on the user's role and responsibilities.

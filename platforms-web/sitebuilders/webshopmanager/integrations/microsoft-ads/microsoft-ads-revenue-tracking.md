# Microsoft Ads Revenue Tracking

To add Microsoft Ads revenue tracking to a website on WebShopManager, you will need to follow these steps:

1. Sign in to your Microsoft Advertising account, and navigate to the Conversion Tracking page.
2. Select "Revenue Tracking" and click "Create revenue goal."
3. Provide a name for your goal, select the currency you will be using, and set the revenue value that you want to track.
4. Choose the conversion page that you want to track, and generate the tracking code for that goal.
5. Log in to your WebShopManager account and navigate to the "System > Configuration" page.
6. Click on "Checkout," then select "Order Tracking"
7. Click "Add Analytics Code," then paste in the Microsoft Ads tracking code that you generated earlier.
8. Save your changes and publish your website.

Once you have completed these steps, Microsoft Ads revenue tracking will be enabled for your website on WebShopManager. The tracking code will fire whenever a user completes the desired action on your website, and the revenue will be tracked in your Microsoft Advertising account. This will allow you to better understand the effectiveness of your Microsoft Ads campaigns and optimize them for better performance.

# Remove user access

To remove a user in Squarespace, follow these steps:

1. Log in to your Squarespace account and go to the "Settings" section.
2. Click on "Permissions" in the left-hand menu.
3. Locate the user you wish to remove in the list of users.
4. Click on the "..." button to the right of the user's name.
5. Click on "Remove" in the drop-down menu.
6. Confirm that you wish to remove the user by clicking on "Remove" in the confirmation dialog box.

That's it! The user will now be removed from your Squarespace account and will no longer have access to any areas or functions. Note that you will not be able to recover any data or information that the user had access to, so make sure to back up any important data before removing a user.

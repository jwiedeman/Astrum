# Oculus

Oculus is a brand of virtual reality (VR) headsets and technology developed by Oculus VR, which was acquired by Facebook in 2014. The Oculus headset allows users to enter immersive virtual environments and experience games, movies, and other content in a 360-degree view. The technology uses sensors and software to track the user's movements and adjust the display accordingly, creating a realistic and engaging experience.

The Oculus headset is available in several different models, including the original Oculus Rift, the Oculus Quest, and the Oculus Go. The Rift is a tethered headset that requires a powerful PC to run, while the Quest is a standalone headset that does not require a PC or wires. The Go is a less powerful and less expensive headset designed for more casual VR experiences.

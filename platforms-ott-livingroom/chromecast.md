# Chromecast

Chromecast is a device developed by Google that allows users to stream content from their smartphone, tablet, or computer to a TV or other display device. The device connects to the TV's HDMI port and is powered by a USB cable, which can be plugged into the TV's USB port or into an external power source.

Chromecast uses Google's Cast technology to stream content directly from a user's device to the TV, bypassing the need for a separate set-top box or media player. The device can stream content from a variety of sources, including YouTube, Netflix, Hulu, and other streaming services, as well as from the user's personal media library.

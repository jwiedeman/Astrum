# Tizen

Tizen is an open-source operating system based on Linux, developed by Samsung and the Linux Foundation. The operating system is designed to run on a variety of devices, including smartphones, tablets, smartwatches, smart TVs, and other IoT (Internet of Things) devices.

Tizen is designed to provide a unified platform for developers to create apps and services that can run on multiple devices, without having to worry about the differences in hardware or software requirements. It is optimized for low-power devices, making it ideal for use in smartwatches and other wearable devices.

One of the key features of Tizen is its security model. The operating system uses a strict permissions system that allows users to control which apps can access their data and other resources. Tizen also includes a secure boot process, which ensures that only trusted code can run on the device.

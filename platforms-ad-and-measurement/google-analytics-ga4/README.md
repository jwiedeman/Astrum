# Google Analytics - GA4

Google Analytics GA4 (Google Analytics 4) is the latest version of Google's web analytics platform. It was launched in October 2020 and offers a new set of features and capabilities compared to its predecessor, Universal Analytics.

One of the key differences between GA4 and Universal Analytics is the way data is collected and analyzed. In GA4, the focus is on event-based tracking, which means that website interactions are tracked as events, rather than as pageviews. This allows for more granular tracking of user behavior and provides a better understanding of how users are interacting with a website.

Other key features of Google Analytics GA4 include:

1. Integration with Google Ads: GA4 provides a more streamlined integration with Google Ads, allowing for better tracking and optimization of advertising campaigns.
2. User-centric measurement: GA4 offers more insights into user behavior, including how users are interacting with a website across different devices and platforms.
3. Automated insights: GA4 includes machine learning-powered insights that can help website owners identify trends and opportunities for improvement.
4. Better privacy controls: GA4 offers more control over data collection and includes new features to help website owners comply with privacy regulations.
5. Customizable dashboards: GA4 offers more flexibility in dashboard design, allowing website owners to create custom reports that focus on specific metrics and dimensions.

Overall, Google Analytics GA4 represents a major shift in the way web analytics is performed. It offers new insights and capabilities that can help website owners better understand their users and optimize their websites for better performance.

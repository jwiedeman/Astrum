# Google Ads

Google Ads (formerly known as Google AdWords) is an advertising platform created by Google that allows businesses to create and display ads on Google's search engine results pages, as well as on other websites that partner with Google to display ads.

With Google Ads, businesses can create a variety of ad formats, including search ads, display ads, video ads, and shopping ads. These ads can be targeted to specific audiences based on factors such as demographics, interests, behaviors, and search terms.

Google Ads uses a pay-per-click (PPC) model, which means that businesses only pay when someone clicks on their ad. The cost per click (CPC) varies depending on factors such as the competition for the keyword, the relevance of the ad, and the quality of the landing page.

In addition to targeting and pricing options, Google Ads also provides businesses with a variety of tools and features for measuring ad performance and optimizing campaigns based on data and insights. These tools include conversion tracking, A/B testing, and remarketing.

Overall, Google Ads is a powerful advertising platform that allows businesses of all sizes to create and display ads on Google's search engine and other websites, helping them reach their target audience and achieve their marketing goals.
